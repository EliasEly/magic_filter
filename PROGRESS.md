# ARM INTERNSHIP

__The main objectif of that intership is to discover SVE.__

### Until the 17th of July
I've been reading some docs, trying to figure out how to work with the BigDFT kernel and Libconv (the one on Luigis Git).
I was totally going in the wrong direction. Moreover I was stuck and because of the CTI Audit Pr. Mehaut was kinda busy.

On Friday 17th of July, we had a call and the ARM engineers told me what to do.

### Monday 20th July

Here it starts for real ! I'm working in parallel on my own OS kernel. So I have to keep everything really organized to don't mess up.

I'm working on the MAGIC_FILTER optimized for SSE.
I have a great Github that may be very useful. [SSE2NEON](https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon) where NEON is the ARM Vectorization. I think it will help me to understand how it works.

A close goal would be to optimize the kernel for SVE.
